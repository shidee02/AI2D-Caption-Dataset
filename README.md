# AI2D-Caption: Human-Annotated Descriptive Captions for Diagrams

## Overview
This repository presents an **augmented version of the AI2D dataset**, where we introduce **human-annotated descriptive captions** for a subset of scientific diagrams. The goal of this extension is to facilitate research in **diagram understanding, multimodal reasoning, and vision–language modeling**.

---

## Reference to the Original Dataset
The original AI2D dataset was introduced in the paper:

> **A Diagram Is Worth A Dozen Images**  

Users are strongly encouraged to **refer to the original paper and dataset** for details regarding diagram collection, structural annotations, and semantic categorization.

---

## ✍️ Human-Annotated Caption Extension
In this work, **no modifications are made to the original AI2D images or labels**.  
We only add **new human-authored natural language captions** that describe the overall semantic content of each diagram in a coherent and descriptive manner.

These captions are:
- Written by human annotators  
- Focused on global diagram understanding  
- Intended to complement existing AI2D annotations

## 📊 Sample Annotations
A small set of representative examples is provided below to illustrate the nature of the human-annotated captions.
